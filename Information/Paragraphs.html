<h1><p style="text-align:center;background-color:#A58BFA;">Pollution in the US and How We Can Help</p></h1>
	<h2>What is Pollution?</h2>
    <div>
    <p>"Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change."<br>
    This is the official definition by Google. Some types of pollution include water pollution, air 
    pollution, and<br> thermal pollution, but today we will be focusing on air pollution. Air pollution can come
    from factories, cars,<br> trucks, volcanoes, wildfires, and other sources. These gas and liquid particles are
    suspended in the air<br>,causing negative effects on wildlife and the environment. Air pollution can result
    in lung cancer, heart disease,<br> and so much more. A well known environmental effect of air pollution is
    acid rain, which is extremely damaging<br> to the environment.</p> 
    </div>
    <h2>How can we control Air Pollution?</h2>
    <div>
    <p>There is not a good way to clean up air pollution, but we can make changes in our lives to reduce the<br> 
    amount of pollution we are releasing in the air. We can use public transportation to reduce the amount<br>
    of trips we take in our cars, avoid burning things, and develop cleaner ways of
    producing energy<br> and electricity.</p>
