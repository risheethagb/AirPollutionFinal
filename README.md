## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hailena/Pollution-Map-2/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

    <h2>What is pollution?</h2>
    <p>
      "Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change." <br>
      This is the official definition by Google. Some types of pollution include water pollution, air <br>
      pollution, and thermal pollution, but today we will be focusing on air pollution. Air pollution can come<br>
      from factories, cars, trucks, volcanoes, wildfires, and other sources. These gas and liquid particles are<br>
      suspended in the air,ccausing negative effects on wildlife and the environment. Air pollution can result <br>
      in lung cancer, heart disease, and so much more. A well known environmental effect of air pollution is <br>
      acid rain, which is extremely damaging to the environment.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>How can we stop air pollution?</h2>
    <p>
      There is not a good way to clean up air pollution, but we can make changes in our lives to reduce the <br>
      amount of pollution we are releasing in the air. We can use public transportation to reduce the amount <br>
      of trips we take in our cars, avoid burning things, and develop cleaner ways of <br>
      producing energy and electricity
