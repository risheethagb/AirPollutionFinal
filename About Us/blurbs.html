    <p class="hailena">
    Hailena attends Thomas Jefferson High School, and took a <br>
    java class in school. She has never taken any computer <br>
    science class outside of school, but she tried to learn <br>
    some Python basics on her own. She had no knowledge of <br>
    web development, html, or css, but she learned it to <br>
    make the website for this hackathon. She enjoys <br>
    researching and learning on her own, and looks forward<br>
    to learn more about web development in the future.
