	<p style="text-align:center;"> Welcome to <b>Terra v. Trains</b>, our Pollution Pygame that challenges you to plant trees and overcome your carbon production/footstep! 
<br>
Instructions for the PyGame : 
<ul>
	<li><b>Your train and tree points:</b> The dark brown-red squares represent your train. The dark green squares represent trees that you collect to “plant”. Every time you collect a tree, your train caboose adds one compartment and 1 point is added to your “Number of Trees” score.</li>
   <br>	
	<li><b>Carbon Points:</b> For every 3 key movements you make (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT) with your keyboard, 1 point is also added to your “Carbon” score. This represents the carbon production of your train, similar to that of daily transportation when you move the vehicle.</li>
 <br>
	<li><b>When does your game end?</b> When your train hits the walls OR hits itself, the game is over.</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>How do you win?</b> If the number of trees you’ve collected at the end (tree points) is GREATER THAN the carbon (carbon points) you’ve produced, YOU WIN! Otherwise, feel free to try again by clicking C, or quitting by clicking Q.</li>

</ul>
